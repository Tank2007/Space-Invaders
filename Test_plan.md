# Test Plan for Galactic War Troubles

## Part 1. Unit Testing the Game Mechanics
### Description
Test individual game mechanics, such as movement, shooting, and collision detection.

| **Test Case**                | **Test Data**                              | **Expected Outcome**                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Player movement              | Move mouse to `(x, y)`                     | Spaceship follows the mouse's `x` coordinate.                                                                                                                   |
| Bullet firing                | Left mouse click while playing             | A projectile spawns at the playerâ€™s position and moves upward.                                                                                                  |
| Collision with enemy         | Projectile intersects with an enemy sprite | Enemy is removed from the screen, score increases, explosion sound plays, and projectile is removed.                                                            |
| Boundary limits for enemies  | Enemy at `(screen_width, y)` tries to move | Enemy wraps to the other side of the screen or stops depending on design.                                                                                       |
| Power-up activation          | Player touches power-up at `(x, y)`        | Power-up activates its effect (e.g., shield, double fire) and starts a countdown timer.                                                                          |

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Score calculation             | Enemy destroyed                   | Score increases by `+10`.                                                                                         |
| Level progression             | Score milestones (100, 200, 500) | Game level increases, and enemy speed increases incrementally by `+10%`.                                          |
| Power-up duration             | Activate shield power-up          | Player is invincible for `10 seconds`. Shield deactivates, and normal gameplay resumes.                           |
| Bonus for multi-kill          | Destroy 3 enemies simultaneously | Score bonus of `+50 points` is applied.                                                                           |
| Asteroid collision            | Asteroid destroyed by projectile  | Possible random drop of power-up (e.g., `1 in 3` chance) and asteroid disappears.                                  |

| Power-up collision at boundary    | Power-up spawns at `(screen_width, y)`     | Power-up remains within screen boundaries and is collectible by the player.                           |
| Fastest enemy speed               | Enemy speed maxes out after level `10`     | Gameplay continues smoothly without glitches.                                                         |
| Clearing all enemies simultaneously | All enemies hit by explosion power-up    | Game transitions to the next wave without skipping or freezing.                                       |

|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scoring after enemy hit           | Projectile collides with enemy           | Score updates on-screen immediately after enemy is destroyed.                                             |
| Menu interaction                  | Click on "Pause Menu" button             | Gameplay freezes, and menu options are displayed. Clicking "Resume" restarts gameplay seamlessly.         |
| Power-up collection with enemies  | Collect power-up while enemies are active | Power-up effect is applied, and enemies continue normal behavior.                                         |

## Part 5. Handling Bad Input and Run-Time Errors
### Description
Ensure that invalid input or errors do not crash the game.
