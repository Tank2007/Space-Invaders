### 1. App Idea
**Concept**: *Galactic War Troubles* is inspired by *Space Invaders* but introduces power-ups, an updated design, and mouse-controlled aiming through a turret. Players will defend a space station by shooting down alien spaceships as they orbit an asteroid ring around Saturn.

### 2. Target Audience
This game is designed for all ages, targeting players who enjoy skill-based shooter games and want to test their ability to protect humanity.

### 3. Goals and Vision
The objective is to shoot and destroy aliens attempting to crash into the player's home spacecraft. As players orbit Saturn's asteroid ring, they can destroy incoming asteroids, which may drop items like bombs, gravity waves, and explosive bullets. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score.

### 4. Key Features
- **Gameplay**: Single-player or two-player mode.
- **Objective**: Score points by shooting more aliens and progressing through increasingly challenging waves.
- **Items**: Collect power-ups from destroyed asteroids, such as bombs, gravity waves, and explosive bullets.
- **Menus**: Includes a main menu, pause menu, and settings menu.
- **Graphics and Visuals**: Pixelated graphics with vivid effects and flashing lights for an arcade appeal.
- **Controls**: Mouse-controlled aiming with a visible crosshair.

### 5. Success Criteria
To achieve our vision, we aim to create an arcade-like experience with eye-catching graphics and lighting effects that draw in players. Success will be measured by:
- Engaging visuals and effects that capture attention.
- A challenging, score-based game that encourages replayability.

### 6. Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: PC, with controller support.
- **Performance**: Runs at 60 frames per second.
- **Audio**: Sound effects and music played continuously.
- **Interface**: Chat box, flashing lights, crosshair aiming.
- **Graphics**: High-quality pixelated art and animations.
- **Music**: Custom-made background music to enhance gameplay.
